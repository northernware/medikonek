# MEDIKONEK

Appointments and medical records for family practice, organised by household.

A doctor signs in, creates a **household**, adds its members as **patients**,
books **appointments** against one of fifteen services, and documents each visit
as a **medical record** with vitals, assessment, plan and prescriptions. A month
**calendar** shows which days are booked and at what times. Everything a doctor
creates is visible only to that doctor.

Every patient keeps their own record, appointment history, diagnoses and
prescriptions. The household is a grouping, not a merged chart — it exists so a
doctor can find relatives quickly, schedule a family checkup, see hereditary
risk, record how members relate to one another, and hold one shared address and
contact number.

## Stack

- **Next.js 16** (App Router, Server Components, Server Actions) + React 19
- **Prisma 8** (Prisma Next) against **PostgreSQL**, via `@prisma/orm-postgres`
- **Tailwind CSS v4** with a light/dark clinical palette in `app/globals.css`
- **Auth**: email + bcrypt password, session as a signed JWT (`jose`) in an
  HttpOnly cookie
- **Validation**: Zod schemas shared by every server action

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env        # then fill in DATABASE_URL and SESSION_SECRET
npm run db:migrate          # bring the database up to the contract
npm run db:seed             # optional: a demo practice to click around in
npm run dev
```

Generate a session secret with:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64url'))"
```

The seed creates a demo doctor — **doctor@medikonek.test** / **medikonek-demo** —
with two households, seven patients, seventeen appointments spread across the
month and a few past encounters.
Delete it before going anywhere near real data.

### Database

The data layer is Prisma 8 (Prisma Next), which is contract-first: the schema
lives in `src/prisma/contract.prisma`, and `prisma contract emit` derives the
runtime types (`contract.d.ts`) and the artefact the client reads
(`contract.json`) from it. Both are committed, and `prebuild` re-emits them, so a
clean checkout typechecks and builds without a database.

Any PostgreSQL connection string works — Prisma Postgres, Neon, Supabase, RDS or
your own server. Put it in `DATABASE_URL`; `npm run db:migrate` applies the
migrations under `migrations/app/` and needs no shadow database.

Changing the schema is three steps: edit `src/prisma/contract.prisma`, run
`npm run db:emit`, then either `npm run db:update` to push the change straight
into a development database, or `npm run db:plan` to write a migration to disk
for the ones you deploy to. `npm run db:verify` reports whether a database
matches the contract.

### Upgrading a database created before Prisma 8

A database built by the old Prisma 7 migrations is one change away from matching
the contract: Prisma 7 enforced the two `MedicalRecord` links with bare unique
indexes, and Prisma 8 declares uniqueness as a constraint. Everything else — the
tables, columns, native enum types and other indexes — is byte-identical.

```bash
npm run db:verify   # "Marker missing" — Prisma 8 has never signed this database
npm run db:update   # drops the two indexes, adds the constraints, signs it
```

`db:update` prints the plan and asks for confirmation, because dropping an index
is destructive in general; here each one is immediately replaced by the unique
constraint's own index, so the guarantee never lapses. Confirm it by passing the
database's name (`npm run db:update -- --confirm <dbname>`) or by answering the
prompt. Afterwards `db:verify` reports that marker and schema match the contract.

Do not run `db:seed` against a database with real patients in it — it creates a
demo practice.

## Deploying

The app deploys to **Vercel** as an ordinary Next.js app — no adapter, no build
flags, no `output` setting. Import the repository, then set two environment
variables under *Settings → Environment Variables* for every environment you
want to build:

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | A PostgreSQL connection string. Use a **pooled** endpoint — serverless functions open a connection per instance. |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | 32 random bytes; generate it with the command above. Rotating it signs everyone out. |

Neither is read at import time, so the build succeeds without a database — which
also means a missing variable surfaces on the first request rather than in the
build log. If pages throw `DATABASE_URL is not set` after a green deploy, the
variable is missing from that environment, not from the code.

Create the schema before the first request, from your own machine against the
same database:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="<the connection string>" npm run db:migrate
```

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLINIC_TIMEZONE` too if the clinic is not in `Asia/Manila`; it
is inlined at build time, so changing it needs a redeploy.

### Data model

`Doctor → Household → Patient`, with `Appointment` and `MedicalRecord` hanging
off a patient and `Prescription` off a record. A record optionally links to the
appointment it documents; making that link marks the appointment completed.

### The clinical flow

The release target is one unbroken path, and each step hands off to the next:

```
register patient → group under household → book appointment
  → check in → document consultation → prescribe → schedule follow-up
```

The dashboard is where that flow is driven. Today's schedule carries a **Check
in** button; checking someone in moves them to a **Waiting room** panel with a
**Start consultation** link that opens a record already bound to their booking;
documenting the visit marks the appointment completed; the record offers
**Print prescription**; and a follow-up date raises the visit in **Follow-ups
due** until an appointment is booked against it.

That last link is explicit — `MedicalRecord.followUpAppointmentId` — so "due"
means *asked for and not yet booked*, rather than a guess from whatever
appointments happen to sit near the date. Booking from the dashboard or the
record sets it and the item drops off the list.

### Booking rules

One module, `lib/scheduling.ts`, holds the clinic's rules: open 8:00 AM to
5:00 PM, closed Sundays, and a booking must be at least one day ahead (and at
most 180). The booking form mirrors them — the date input is bounded, Sundays
explain themselves, and the slot grid only offers times a visit of that length
actually fits into — but `checkBookingRules` on the server is what decides. A
stale slot list and a direct POST both land there.

Overlap is checked the same way: the form greys out any start time that would
collide with an existing booking, and the action re-checks against the whole
clinic day before writing, so two people racing for the last slot cannot both
get it.

### Clinical lists

Allergies, chronic conditions, current medications and medical alerts are each
lists of rows rather than free text, so an allergy carries its own reaction and
severity and a medication carries its dose and frequency. One `ClinicalPicker`
drives all four — type to filter a grouped catalogue in `lib/clinical.ts`, pick
several, remove them as tags, and add anything the catalogue does not list. The
suggestions are a shortcut, never a constraint. Each picker declares which
per-item detail fields it wants.

Medical alerts sit above the allergies on every chart, appointment and
consultation screen: they are things to act on before touching the patient —
anticoagulants, a pacemaker, a difficult airway — rather than history.

Allergies, conditions and medications also carry a `ClinicalListStatus`, because
**an empty list is not the same as "no known allergies"**. `UNKNOWN` (nobody has asked) renders as an
amber warning on the chart; `NONE_KNOWN` (asked, none found) renders as a quiet
confirmation; `RECORDED` renders the list itself, worst severity first. Nothing
reads as safe by omission.

### Deleting a list

`.delete()` on the Prisma 8 ORM removes **one** row — it is shaped for a unique
predicate. Anywhere a delete is keyed on something non-unique (a patient's
clinical lists, a record's prescriptions) it goes through the SQL-builder lane
instead: `tx.sql.public.<Table>.delete().where(...)`. Using the ORM there left
every row but one behind and the next insert collided with the unique index.

### Services

Every appointment carries a `ServiceType` from a fixed list of fifteen — general
consultation, family checkup, follow-up, routine physical, pediatric, senior
citizen, prenatal/postnatal, chronic disease management, prescription renewal,
laboratory result review, medical certificate, vaccination, minor injury and
wound care, teleconsultation, and referral. The catalogue lives in one place,
`SERVICES` in `lib/domain.ts`, which also carries each service's description and
its default slot length. Duration is derived from the service rather than asked
for — the slot picker needs to know how much of the day a visit consumes.
Free-text `reason` still carries the specifics.

### Calendar

`/calendar?month=YYYY-MM&day=YYYY-MM-DD` renders whole Sunday-first weeks for the
month, each day cell showing its booked times in a compact form (`9:00a`) with a
colour per status — phones get density dots instead, where there is no room for
text. The selected day's full schedule sits in a sticky panel **beside** the
grid on large screens, stacking underneath on small ones. Selecting an empty day
offers a booking link prefilled to it, and picking a leading or trailing cell
moves the grid to that neighbouring month. Days are bucketed by a
clinic-timezone `YYYY-MM-DD` key, so the month query stays a single indexed
range scan.

### Security notes

- Server Actions are reachable by direct POST, so **every** action calls
  `requireDoctor()` and scopes its query by `doctorId` — the layout guard is
  convenience, not the boundary. Reads and writes for another doctor's ids come
  back as 404 / "not on your list", never as data.
- Passwords are bcrypt with cost 12. A failed login compares against a decoy
  hash so a wrong email and a wrong password take the same time, and the error
  never says which was wrong.
- The session cookie is HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax, and Secure in production.
  Rotating `SESSION_SECRET` signs everyone out.

### Timezone

Appointment times are rendered in the clinic's timezone rather than the
viewer's, so server-rendered markup and the doctor's wall clock agree. It
defaults to `Asia/Manila`; set `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLINIC_TIMEZONE` to change it.

## Not yet built

**A patient-facing portal.** The doctor books on the patient's behalf today.
Patients choosing their own slot needs patient accounts, a public booking flow,
and a review step for `PENDING` requests. `BookingSource.PATIENT_PORTAL` exists
so those bookings will be distinguishable when it lands.

**Multiple doctors per clinic.** One account is one doctor, and every query
scopes to the signed-in doctor's own records. A "which doctor" field on booking
needs a clinic that owns doctors, per-doctor availability, and a rethink of that
scoping — it is not a dropdown.

**Attending household members.** `FAMILY_CHECKUP` labels the visit but still
books one patient. Several members in one appointment needs a join table and a
decision about whose record the encounter belongs to.

**Roles and permissions.** Every account is a doctor with full access to its own
data. Nurses, receptionists and administrators — and permission-scoped access to
records — are not modelled at all. This is the largest single gap for a clinic
with more than one person in it, and it has to land before an audit trail means
anything.

**An audit trail.** Nothing records who viewed or changed a record. For
Philippine Data Privacy Act purposes this is not optional, and retrofitting it
after roles exist is the right order.

**Patient documents and lab results.** No file storage of any kind, so uploaded
labs, referral letters and images have nowhere to go. Laboratory *requests* are
likewise unmodelled — a visit can describe them in the plan, but they are not
structured or trackable.

**Medical certificates and referral letters.** The printable prescription is the
only document the app produces; these two would follow the same shape.

**Billing, payments and receipts. Reporting and CSV/Excel export. Reminder
delivery. Two-factor authentication. Session timeouts. Consent records.** None
started.

**Calendar depth.** Month view only — no day or week view, no clinic-hours
editing, no breaks, leave or blocked dates, no filtering by service or status,
no drag-to-reschedule.

**Attachments** (labs, referral letters, images) need file storage, which the
app has none of yet.

**Reminders** are recorded as a preference only; nothing sends anything.

Also outstanding: repeat/recurring appointments, week and day calendar views,
per-doctor working hours and holidays beyond the fixed Sunday closure,
printable prescriptions and medical certificates, an audit trail of who changed
what, and soft deletes — deletion is permanent.
